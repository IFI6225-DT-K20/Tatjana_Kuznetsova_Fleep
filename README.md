Copied website: https://fleep.io/home
  Reason: challenging animations
  
Used framework: Semantic UI https://semantic-ui.com/
  Reason: I have already used Bootstrap and Semantic UI in another projects.
          That's why I have decided to use Foundation by ZURB in the first place. 
          But, because on 09.02.2020 Foundation by ZURB website is not working, I have decided to change it for Semantic UI.
          I used Bootstrap For bigger projects, but semantic UI - only once and very briefly. If I can't get Foundation, I'd like to learn 
          Semantic UI a bit deeper.
